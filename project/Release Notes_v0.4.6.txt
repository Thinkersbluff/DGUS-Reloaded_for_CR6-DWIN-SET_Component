Last updated: 7 Feb 2025

New at release 0.4.6 - Stable:

New Features:

 - Added colour-coding to the  bed mesh, with a user-defined threshold for what is deemed "green"
 - Reworked the workflow, to allow:
   - paging through the existing bed mesh profiles
   - selecting Run ABL to generate a new bed_mesh to replace the one currently displayed
   - commanding a Klipper Restart, to cancel the pending SAVE_CONFIG, if the new profile is invalid (e.g. if the printer had probe issues)

 - Added new screen bitmaps for a future Extruder Calibration function (not implemented at this release)
 - Removed the old Heat Presets popup menus, made redundant at v0.4.5 (Moved to the Other Graphics folder, just in case...)



Bugfixes:

    -  None
	
Known Issues at this release: (No change since v0.4.3)

 - If you modify the Screen Brightness setting, Klipper may crash next time you issue a SAVE_CONFIG command.  This is an unfortunate behaviour of Klipper and not a bug in this firmware.  

 - If your Virtual SD Card contains any files which do NOT end in .gcode, the filelist should exclude that file.
  * If, however, while scrolling through the list, your system suddenly shuts down - check for any such files in ~/printer_data/gcodes. 
    Deleting those files should fix the problem.

 - The RESET and FIRMWARE RESET buttons on the splash screen do not work on power-up.
      They do work after a FIRMWARE RESET from the Mainsail Web client. (NOTE: This may not be "fixable" Klipper seems to need to initialize those remote controls while being reset...)
    	There is no work-around for this issue.
 
CAUTION:

 - The FONT (.HZK) file changed at release v0.3.3.
	- If it is included in the DWIN_SET folder, it slows the flashing process
	- That file is in the "One-ime DWIN_SET files" folder
	- If you have not flashed it to your system before, you should copy that to DWIN_SET for one time
	- After flashing it once to the display, that file can again be removed from DWIN_SET
	- If you already flashed that file to your display, you do NOT need to flash it again.

Cheers!
